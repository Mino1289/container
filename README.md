# container

## Description

A WIP Tool to manage loads/unloads of containers from ships.

## Usage
I don't know yet.

## TODO / Roadmap

- [ ] Read a list of containers from a file and manage which containers are loaded/unloaded from which ports
- [ ] Output a list of files for all ports with the containers to be loaded/unloaded (basic thing "get"/"put")
- [ ] Maybe a GUI?
